# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview  
**Name:** Simplify & Dumb-Down LinkedIn Post Rewriter Extension  
**Description:** A solo-built React-based browser extension that ingests LinkedIn post content and automatically rewrites it into simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and a lightly “dumber” tone—ideal for conveying information in a casual, laid-back style.

---

## 1. Goals & Objectives  
- **Primary Goal:** Allow a single developer to build and ship a React-based extension that transforms professional‐sounding LinkedIn posts into an intentionally simplified, casual tone.  
- **Objectives:**  
  1. **Accuracy:** Preserve original meaning and key takeaways.  
  2. **Simplicity:** Reduce average sentence length by ~30%.  
  3. **Tone Shift:** Inject mild colloquialisms (“um,” “like,” “you know”) without offense.  
  4. **Performance:** Rewrite in under 2 seconds on modern consumer hardware.  
  5. **Privacy:** Communicate privacy trade-offs clearly; minimal text sent to API.

## 2. User Personas & Use Cases  

| Persona                 | Description                                           | Use Case                                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Casual Influencer**   | Wants to appear relatable and down-to-earth in posts. | Takes a formal announcement and makes it “chill.”      |
| **Social Media Manager**| Manages a small business LinkedIn page solo.          | Quickly experiments with tone variants for engagement. |
| **Language Learner**    | Non-native English speaker practicing informal tone.  | Rewrites professional posts to learn colloquialisms.   |

## 3. Functional Requirements  

1. **Content Extraction**  
   - Detect LinkedIn post text within the page DOM.  
   - Trigger via extension icon click or right-click menu.

2. **Rewrite Engine (Gemini API)**  
   - Send extracted text plus user settings to Google’s Gemini API over HTTPS.  
   - Payload includes: raw text, desired simplification level, “dumbify” toggle, filler-word frequency.  
   - Receive JSON response with rewritten text.  
   - Handle API errors and rate limits gracefully.

3. **User Controls & Settings**  
   - **Simplification Level:** Low / Medium / High.  
   - **Dumbify Toggle:** On / Off.  
   - **Filler Frequency:** None / Rare / Frequent.  
   - **Preview Pane:** Side-by-side original vs. rewritten, implemented as a React component.

4. **Output Integration**  
   - Overwrite LinkedIn editor in-place.  
   - Copy rewritten text to clipboard.

5. **Feedback & Analytics**  
   - In-extension button to log poor rewrites (local storage).  
   - Optional anonymous telemetry: request latency, settings usage (with user consent).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements  

| Category         | Requirement                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**  | ≥90% of requests complete in <2s (network + API).         |
| **Security**     | All API calls over TLS; API key stored securely in extension. |
| **Privacy**      | Only post text and minimal metadata sent; privacy policy explains. |
| **Compatibility**| Chrome, Firefox, Edge (latest two versions).             |
| **Accessibility**| WCAG AA contrast; full keyboard navigation.               |
| **Localization** | English only (MVP).                                       |

## 5. UX/UI & Interaction Flows  

1. **Install & Onboarding**  
   - Install from browser store → modal explains “what data is sent” and privacy settings.

2. **Rewriting a Post**  
   - Click extension icon or right-click → “Simplify & Dumb-Down.”  
   - React-powered sidebar shows original vs. new text.  
   - Adjust sliders/toggles → live preview via Gemini API calls.  
   - Click “Apply” or “Copy.”

3. **Settings Panel**  
   - Accessible via icon menu.  
   - Controls for default simplification, “dumbify,” filler frequency, telemetry opt-in/out, and “Reset.”

## 6. Technical Architecture  

- **Extension UI:**  
  - **Framework:** React (functional components + hooks)  
  - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS via CDN  
  - Chrome/Firefox/Edge WebExtension manifest v3

- **Rewrite Engine:**  
  - **API:** Google Gemini REST endpoint  
  - **Auth:** API key stored in extension’s secure storage  
  - **Rate-Limit Handling:** exponential backoff, user notification on quota hit

- **Data Flow:**  
  1. Content script extracts post text.  
  2. Background script sends HTTPS POST to Gemini API.  
  3. Gemini returns rewritten text.  
  4. UI (React) displays and applies it.
